# Optimization

This repository contains optimization techniques learnt in my graduate classes. 

The solver we used is called Gurobi. 

In order to run this code, please install gurobi. 

The main techniques used in optimization here are:

1. English Description: Describing what the manager/client is really asking you to optimize
2. Concrete Formulation: Mathematically representing the ask using latex in python
3. Abstract Formulation: Mathematically represting the ask in a shorter way to handle arbitrarily large formulations 

The examples in my code will include a mix of all three methods to solve a problem using gurobi. There is also code that creates a function which creates certain common problems into reusable software for arbitrarily large variables.
